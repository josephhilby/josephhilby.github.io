I started actually writing code in August of 2022. I had played around with HTML and Python before then, but not in any serious manner.

If you'll forgive me for such an overused metaphor, it felt like my monitor had become the looking glass. A view port through which some oddly colored coordinated text document became an object. Not corporeal but still real. Describable. Useable. With each practice project I became a incrementally better at coordinating these documents. I could describe and coordinate a whole range of things. I could manage and use the files and directories needed to create an application... except one. The README. My understanding of this little structure, in each of my GitHub repos, was minimal at best.

It wasn't as if I did'nt try to improve my use and understanding of READMEs. I searched through templates (props to [Best-README-Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template)) and I attempted to recreate the success others had; I tried on everyone elses ideas because I had none of my own. It was frustrating and that frustration was compounded by the growth the rest of my fledgling skills were showing. However, I, just recently, think I made my first breakthrough in this little endeavor. It may sound stupid (or obvious) and I don't want to oversell it as some great epiphany. Just my idea. One I like. One that I am proud of.

I started writing it for my desired audience.

I can already feel you moving your mouse to close out this tab in your browser (you probably have too many open anyway). I promise. I have a more then just *that*. So lets take a quick step backward.

> - Richard Kim

I love this contextualization by Richard Kim but I can't live up to it (yet). I'm not yet building for developers or customers, I'm building projects for my future employer. I am building them to showcase my potential, my growth, and my current ability. It also happens that building these projects improves all of those factors but that is beside the point. So, if my repos are for a potential employer, what is the problem of theirs I can solve? I would argue it's this: "Will I hire this person?"

Conveniently enough helping a future employer solve this problem is quite beneficial to me and still challenges me to continue good practices like: RESTful architecture, DRY code, 4 Pillars of OOP, etc. It also gives me a bit more direction for my READMEs. I am no longer trying to write for some amorphous audience. They exist out there and have problems that I can help solve.

Now that I have identified who I see my audience as and what I see their problem to be, I will spend a bit of time to define that audience. Firstly, I am actually using the singular *employer* to refer to a handful of people engaging in the hiring process. They are (as I imagine them) broken down into three categories: Human Resources/Recruitment, Managers, and Software Engineers. I also assume that I will have to engage with each group, one after the other, in that given order and that while they as a group have the problem "Will I hire this person" they each, individually have a slightly different part of that problem. I am not going to be mentioning any Applicant Tracking System (ATS). I am only concerned with human eyeballs reading my work and this would mean that, more then likely, my application has already made it past any ATS.

Let's look at and help each one solve their problem:
- HR: Wants to take a large group of applicants reduce this to a limited group for the managers.
- Managers: Want to take that reduced list and evaluate their work and produce a final selection for the engineering team.
- Software Engineers: Want to take that final selection and really ensure their work and ability wont be a hindrance to the team.
