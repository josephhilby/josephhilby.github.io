Hi,

I'm Joe. I spent ten years as a Navy Pilot, then transitioned out of the military and had to decide what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

I had grown up as a 'digital native' but realized I knew painfully little about the machines that ran an unbelievable amount of my life. So I decided to change that. I am hoping to document that change. While I cannot make any claims to a deep knowledge of the topics I will talk about, I do hope others get some amount of value on the perspective I bring. That being someone who is technologically literate, critically minded, inquisitive, and actively trying to become technologically capable.

If you are still here. Thank you for reading. Please feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn!
